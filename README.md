<h2>Mekanik Village provides access to the biggest selection of ready-to-ship aftermarket parts, tools, and accessories, benefiting significant automotive sectors.</h2>

MekanikVillage is an e-commerce web application that helps bridge the gap between vehicle parts/accessories retailers and technicians/vehicle owners alike. This e-commerce platform allows sellers to create a store on the app and list their products, while buyers can search from available products, place orders, and checkout securely through Stripe payment processing.
## Tech Stack

The MekanikVillage e-commerce web app uses the following technologies:

   * Express.js: a web framework for Node.js used for building APIs and web applications
   * Node.js: a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
   * MongoDB: a NoSQL document-oriented database
   * Mongoose: an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js
   * Passport: an authentication middleware for Node.js used to authenticate requests
   * EJS: a JavaScript templating language used for creating dynamic HTML
   * Stripe: a payment processing platform for internet businesses

## Architecture

The application architecture for MekanikVillage is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This pattern separates the application into three interconnected components: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (logic and dataflow).

The MVC architecture provides a clear separation of concerns and helps to maintain a modular codebase that is easier to maintain and scale.
